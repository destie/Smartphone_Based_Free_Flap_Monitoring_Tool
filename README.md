Code and information overview for free Flap monitoring tool created using video data and machine learning. 

A "Free flap" is a medical term for a procedure that involves transporting tissue and a corresponding blood supply from one part of the body to the next. An important component of monitoring the success of a free-flap (both during the procedure and immediately after), is to ensure vascular sufficiency. This means that it's important to ensure blood flow is still occuring in the transplanted tissue.

Postoperative flap failure can lead to multiple complications including need for further salvage surgery and increased hospitilization. Early detection of vascular insufficiency is strongly correlated with a decrease in these symptoms. 

Traditional means of monitoring are invasive, expensive, and often non-continuous. The standard of care for most hospitals is often the "doppler," where an ultrasonography probe is used to identify blood flow. Creech and Miller identified criteria for monitoring systems for plastic surgery to be “Continuous, Non-Invasive, Direct, Easy to Interpret, Quantitative, and Not Expensive.” Unfortunately systems like the doppler probe do not meet this criteria and no system available on the current market provides means to meet all of these.
